    <br>ğŸ˜„ Hi there! I'm Hongjun Wu, an art student at University of Washington!<br>
    <br>ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AnimKit, an open-source Maya toolkit written in Python.<br>
    <br>ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Maya, Blender, Pytorch, OpenCV, and Unreal Engine!<br>
    <br>ğŸ’¬ Ask me just about anything you can think of!<br>
    <br>âš¡ Fun fact: I got rejected by the UW CSE department five times in a role :))) I don't care anymore.<br>
