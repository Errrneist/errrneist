    <br>ðŸ˜„ Hi there! I'm Hongjun Wu, an art student at University of Washington!<br>
    <br>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AnimKit, an open-source Maya toolkit written in Python.<br>
    <br>ðŸ˜‰ I also work on many things on the side, like hackintosh dev, CAE, etc.<br>
    <br>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in machine learning (I TA for that course) and animation (Also TA for that)! <br>
    <br>ðŸ’¬ Ask me just about anything you can think of!<br>
    <br>âš¡ Fun fact: I got rejected by UWCSE five times in a role :))) It's ok they don't deserve me.<br>
